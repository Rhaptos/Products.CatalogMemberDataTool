Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.CatalogMemberDataTool.MemberDataTool import MemberDataTool
    >>> MemberDataTool.id == 'portal_memberdata'
    True
    >>> MemberDataTool.meta_type == 'Catalog MemberData Tool'
    True
    >>> type(MemberDataTool. __implements__)
    <class 'Interface._InterfaceClass.Interface'>
